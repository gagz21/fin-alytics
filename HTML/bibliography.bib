title = "Fractional Randomness and the Brownian Bridge",
abstract = "This paper introduces a statistical approach to fractional randomness based on the Central Limit Theorem. We show under general conditions that fractional noise-randomness defined relative to a uniform distribution, implies as well a fractional Brownian Bridge randomness rather than a Fractional Brownian Motion. We analyze further their fractional properties, namely, their variance and covariance and obtain specific results for particular distributions including the fractional uniform distribution and an exponential distribution. The results we obtain have both practical and theoretical implications to the many applications of fractional calculus and in particular, when they are applied to modeling statistical problems where time scaling and randomness prime. This is the case in finance, insurance and risk models as well as in other areas of interest.",

We analyze with various estimators how these relationships are affected by foreign aid flows by focusing on 78 developing countries for 1984-2008. Both types of terrorism are found to depress FDI. Aggregate aid mitigates the negative consequences of domestic and transnational terrorism, but this aid appears more robust in ameliorating the adverse effect of domestic terrorism. However, when aid is subdivided, bilateral aid is effective in reducing the adverse effects of transnational terrorism on FDI, whereas multilateral aid is effective in curbing the adverse effects of domestic terrorism on FDI. For transnational terrorism, there is evidence in the literature that donor countries earmark some bilateral aid to counterterrorism. Aid ability to curb the risk to FDI from terrorism is important because FDI is an important engine of development.}",

It begins by introducing essential concepts including domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism, defensive actions, proactive countermeasures, and guerrilla warfare. Three terrorist event databases, used by seven of the articles, are briefly introduced. These data sets are then used to display some stylized facts about domestic and transnational terrorism during the past four decades. Next, some essential strategic distinctions are drawn between defensive and proactive measures in the case of transnational terrorism when multiple countries are confronted by a common terrorist group. These strategic concerns vanish for domestic terrorism as a central government is able to internalize potential externalities. Finally, the key findings of the articles in the special issue are highlighted in two tables.}",

 abstract = {This paper introduces a new solution method based on Goal Programming for Multiple Objective Decision Making (MODM) problems. The method, called Interactive Sequential Goal Programming (ISGP), combines and extends the attractive features of both Goal Programming and interactive solution approaches for MODM problems. ISGP is applicable to both linear and non-linear problems. It uses existing single objective optimization techniques and, hence, available computer codes utilizing these techniques can be adapted for use in ISGP. The non-dominance of the "best-compromise" solution is assured. The information required from the decision maker in each iteration is simple. The proposed method is illustrated by solving a nutrition problem.},

  abstract={Using available data from the New York stock market (NYSM) we test four different bi-parametric models to fit the correspondent volume-price distributions at each $10$-minute lag: the Gamma distribution, the inverse Gamma distribution, the Weibull distribution and the log-normal distribution. The volume-price data, which measures market capitalization, appears to follow a specific statistical pattern, other than the evolution of prices measured in similar studies. We find that the inverse Gamma model gives a superior fit to the volume-price evolution than the other models. We then focus on the inverse Gamma distribution as a model for the NYSM data and analyze the evolution of the pair of distribution parameters as a stochastic process. Assuming that the evolution of these parameters is governed by coupled Langevin equations, we derive the corresponding drift and diffusion coefficients, which then provide insight for understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution of the stock market.},
